This file provide links to the raw temperature datasets used in this study. 
Gridded files are too large to include in this repository, but below you will find details 
where to download these datasets.
GMST files are included in /data/raw and details on where they were obtained are included below.


# Gridded datasets
Raw netcdf files of gridded surface temperatures used in this study were downloaded from:

- Berkeley:
https://berkeleyearth.org/data/

Specifically, we use the Global Monthly Land + Ocean average Temperature 
with air temperature at sea ice on a 1 degree x 1 degree Latitude Longitude grid.
Downloaded on April 8, 2025.

- NOAA:
https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaaglobaltemp.html

We downloaded the NOAA Global Surface temperature monthly anomalies on 5 degree x 5 degree grid. 
Downloaded on April 24, 2025.

- NASA:
https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/

We use the gridded monthly temperature anomaly data compressed netcdf files on a
regular 2 degree x 2 degree grid.
Downloaded on April 28, 2025.

- HadCRUT:
https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/HadCRUT.5.0.2.0/download.html

The HadCRUT 5.0.2.0 analysis gridded data ensemble mean were downloaded on 
August 18, 2025.

- DCENT:
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/NU4UGW

The DCENT dataset was downloaded from Harvard dataverse on August 19, 2025. 
Specifically, we downloaded the ensemble mean of the dataset.
